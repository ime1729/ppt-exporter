1 Purpose
═════════

  I am making this proposal as a rough draft of an easy to follow
  language that can be used to make a powerpoint.


2 Language options
══════════════════

2.1 Structure
─────────────

  The overall structure of the language is to have one easy to follow
  command on each line, with as much inference as possible – as long as
  the general structure is correct and the data is in the right place,
  that's really all that we need.


2.2 General example
───────────────────

  ┌────
  │ #title Cornell Survey, 2016
  │ #author Matthew Lin
  │ #slide Prayer vs reading the bible
  │ #chart <make this stuff up later>
  │ #textarea
  │ #slide More information goes here
  │ #textarea Conclusions go here
  └────
  This should give us three slides: a title slide, a slide with a chart
  on the left and a textbox on the right, and another slide, with a full
  sized text box.


3 Where to generate the charts?
═══════════════════════════════

  I am using a node.js library called officegen, and it contains a way
  of making charts natively in powerpoint. I will play around with it
  some more so that we don't necessarily have to have charts as images,
  which would save some work for us.
